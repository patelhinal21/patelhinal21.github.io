I created a basic GitHub portfolio website to showcase some of my projects and skills. The website consists of a few HTML pages styled with CSS. 
The index/home page includes an introductory section about me, an about me page with more details, 
a projects page showcasing some of my work, and a contact page with my information.
I used HTML link tags on the different pages to allow navigation between the various sections of the site. 
The contact page links to my resume which I have uploaded as a PDF file for visitors to download. 
The website also includes some images stored in an images folder to enhance the visual appeal. The styling has been done using custom CSS code in a separate stylesheet file.
Overall, this simple GitHub portfolio website helped me practice my HTML and CSS skills for structuring and styling web content. I was able to utilize various HTML elements like 
links, images, headings, paragraphs etc. and CSS properties for basic layout and formatting."
